This project analyzes employee data using SQL, covering basic queries, **filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation**. It includes **COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()**, and WHERE conditions to assess attrition, salaries, and department-wise trends. CTEs were used for experience-based salary analysis, while **RANK(), DENSE_RANK()**, ROW_NUMBER(), and PARTITION BY helped rank employees and identify top earners.
